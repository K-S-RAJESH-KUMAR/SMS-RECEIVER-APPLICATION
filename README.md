# SMS-RECEIVER-APPLICATION

The purpose of SMS RECEIVER APPLICATION is to provide users with a seamless 
and convenient method of receiving incoming SMS notifications, as well as displaying the 
message content and the corresponding phone number on their device's screen. The application 
leverages an appropriate emulator control to simulate the receipt of an SMS message, allowing 
users to interact with the system as if they were receiving an actual SMS. To achieve this 
functionality, the application utilizes various components and features. Firstly, it employs SMS 
listening capabilities to detect incoming SMS messages. When a new message is received, the 
application generates a notification to alert the user. The notification includes essential details 
such as the message content and the sender's phone number. Upon clicking the SMS 
notification, the application's user interface is launched, displaying the complete message 
content along with the associated phone number. The user can easily read and interact with the 
message, as well as store or delete it as desired. To ensure a realistic testing environment, the 
application incorporates an emulator control. This control allows for the emulation of an 
incoming SMS message, allowing users to experience the entire process of receiving, viewing, 
and interacting with an SMS notification.
